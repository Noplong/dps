/**
 *
 * System tick ISR.
 *
 * This is responsible for regularly calling the OS system tick handler.
 * The system tick handler checks if any timer callbacks are necessary,
 * and runs the scheduler.
 *
 * The CPU automatically saves all registers before calling out to an
 * interrupt handler like this.
 *
 * The system may decide to schedule in a new thread during the call to
 * atomTimerTick(), in which case the program counter will be redirected
 * to the new thread's running location during atomIntExit(). This ISR
 * function will not actually complete until the thread we interrupted is
 * scheduled back in, at which point the end of this function will be
 * reached (after atomIntExit()) and the IRET call by the compiler will
 * return us to the interrupted thread as if we hadn't run any other
 * thread in the meantime. In other words the interrupted thread can be
 * scheduled out by atomIntExit() and several threads could run before we
 * actually reach the end of this function. When this function does
 * finally complete, the return address (the PC of the thread which was
 * interrupted) will be on the interrupted thread's stack because it was
 * saved on there by the CPU when the interrupt triggered.
 *
 * As with all interrupts, the ISR should call atomIntEnter() and
 * atomIntExit() on entry and exit. This serves two purposes:
 *
 * a) To notify the OS that it is running in interrupt context
 * b) To defer the scheduler until after the ISR is completed
 *
 * We defer all scheduling decisions until after the ISR has completed
 * in case the interrupt handler makes more than one thread ready.
